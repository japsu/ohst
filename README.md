# A wrapper around `host` that turns URLs into hostnames

Have you ever pasted something from eg. the browser address bar to `host` just to get this?

    $ host https://github.com/japsu/ohst
    Host https://github.com/japsu/ohst not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

Enter `ohst`, a thin wrapper around `host` that turns URLs into hostnames!

    $ ohst https://github.com/japsu/ohst
    github.com has address 192.30.253.112

All parameters that are not understood by `urllib.parse` are passed verbatim:

    $ ohst -t MX https://github.com/japsu/ohst
    github.com mail is handled by 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.

Also supports `whois`:

    $ owhis https://github.com/japsu/ohst

## Installation

    # symlink
    ln -sf $PWD/ohst.py /usr/local/bin/ohst
    ln -sf $PWD/ohst.py /usr/local/bin/owhis

    # or copy
    install -m 755 ohst.py /usr/local/bin/ohst
    install -m 755 ohst.py /usr/local/bin/owhis
